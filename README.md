# Classification of the images of Lions and Tigers using deep learning Convolutional Neural Network.


Classification of Images using Convolutional Neural Network: Formed a computer vision dataset and classified the images using various deep
learning frameworks such as Convolutional, VGG16 network (transfer learning) etc. and applied data augmentation using Python 

At first we use binge image downloader to download photos of Lions and Tigers in our local runtime and move the files in proper directories. We form a computer vision dataset that involves photos of Lions and Tigers. We make directories of train, validation and test and moved the photos there in order to prepare the dataset. Applied data augmentation to reduce the overfitting. In concusion, the model classified the lions and tigers in zoo with 54% accuracy and lions and tigers in Savanna with 74% accuracy.
